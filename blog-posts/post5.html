      <h1>A Societal Failure</h1>
      <h3>Posted on October 22, 2023. Written by: Pratul Venkatesh</h3>
      <p>Have we failed at society? Given a promise of a life that was never meant to be? Capitalistic greed, endless pursuits, consumer psychology manipulations, all plaguing the dream we so desperately sought. The only animal that pays to live on this planet, they said. Rat races, cold shoulders, and stifling mental health endemics- part two of the plague I dread. A world where we appreciate more the ones who can buy and flaunt something rather than the ones who can actually make those things. </p>
      <p>I seek the moments of love where there is music in the background of my memories when there actually was none. I seek the moments of sportsmanship and being able to call another ‘compadre’, where we challenge the limits of our body strength, and that's all that matters. I seek the moments of work where I can be blessed to call it my ikigai, where there is respect, mutual respect, care, shared visions, and a diffusion of ideas, not just a promise of a paycheck to barely sustain my life for the next day. If you choose to be happy, how can you sit quiet while the rest of the population yet suffers. It's overwhelming otherwise, but I'd say our care and attention as an overall society is too little too less. Where's the love where's the warm embrace that we all so desperately rummage.</p>
      <p>Where's the dream where's the society that I so vehemently crave.</p>

      <h1>Where Did The People Go?</h1>

      <p>Children - everyone had complex personalities - unique and bright.</p>
      <p>The adult? A factory output.</p>
      <p>Every single person drew, read, wrote, danced, sang and ran. Many at times not even good at it (supposedly), but atleast they did.</p>
      <p>Now it feels like chasing personalities, "Oh you do this? That's so cool!," they said so emptily, not remembering the time when we all did.</p>
