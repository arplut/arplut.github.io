      <h1>How To Move Towards a Self-Driving Car Society</h1>
      <h3>Posted on October 22, 2023. Written by: Pratul Venkatesh</h3>
      <p>This is a 20-30 year long-term roadmap.</p>

      <p>Mix of human drivers with self-driving cars ❌</p>
    
      <p>Entirely only self-driving cars ✅</p>
    
      <p>Why? Efficiency increases significantly.</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 14px;">A good video explaining traffic, and also why human driving will always be inefficient.</p>
      <br>

      <p>Currently one can invest heavily in 5G/6G/(7G?) connectivity, IoT technologies and related research. This connectivity at all intersections will facilitate the rapid network needed.</p>

      <p>Work to standardize self-driving car technology guidelines and regulations. Soon mandate new vehicles manufactured to atleast have the capability to upgrade to self-driving (in the form of digital remote control.)</p>

      <p>Roll out region by region, create neighborhoods where only self-driving cars are allowed. Entering such a neighborhood automatically switches to self-driving mode with early warning and indications in route planners.</p>

      <p>Expand until entire city is just a network of self-driving cars.</p>

      <p>This is the future. Invest towards it.</p>

      <p><br><b>Additional Note:</b> While other places might take some time to catch up with making the roads and traffic more orderly, I believe Singapore will be one of the leaders in this area, with related research and progress already underway.</p>
