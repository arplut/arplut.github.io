    <h1>The Late Hours<br></h1>
    <h3><b>Posted on September 26, 2023. By Pratul Venkatesh</b><br> <br></h3>
    <p>
      As children the late hours of night are scary, eery and considered taboo to be awake then, quite literally my mother said she was taught to see it as the "devil's hour." In adulthood, and in today's world, time is no longer sectioned. At different times and at all hours different parts of society run, irrespective of the position of the hands of the clock. heh the analog clock- a maestro & conductor of life (comparing the clock hands to that of the musical conductor in an orchestra.) Today we have societies so complex that all time is valued the same with work that goes on at all times- travel and late night cab drivers, doctors working round the clock, remote working jobs with people communicating overseas (and with friends too), construction crew, city cleaners and technicians that work swiftly at night, high school, university students, and working professionals attending night school, all staying up to study, and what not that goes on. 
      <br>There is also the early mornings, a time missed out on by many. I try so desperately to be an early bird but it has been so long since I've been up early (and not tired.) In fact the past 2 years I think the one period of time I have never been up and about is 6-7am, the one period of time where the last time I was up and about, I saw an entirely different world - canteen stall owners setting up, gardeners tending to their plants, cleaners clearing up the bins, people going for an early morning jog, while a vast majority of people around (university students in this context) were dozing away, to wake up later to their next day of their work and classes, and all the while with the world yet running, never still.
