          <h2 id="privacy-policy">1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            GEODHA (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a civic engagement platform that enables users to report and visualize local
            infrastructure challenges such as littering, water shortages, power outages, and road damage. We value your trust
            and are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it,
            and your rights regarding that data.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

          <h3>a. Account Information</h3>
          <p>

          <h3>b. Reports Submitted by Users</h3>
          <p>Text descriptions, uploaded photos, and approximate location (latitude/longitude) associated with each civic report.</p>

          </p>

          <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>

            for research or public awareness purposes.
          </p>

          <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
          <p>
