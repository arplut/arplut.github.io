            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              GEODHA (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a civic engagement platform that enables users to report and visualize local
              infrastructure challenges such as littering, water shortages, power outages, and road damage. We value your trust
              and are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it,
              and your rights regarding that data.
            </p>
